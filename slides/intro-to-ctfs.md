# Intro to CTFs

#### + other things you should know

---

## CTF

* Capture The Flag
* Special kind of information security competitions
* Use [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org) to track CTFs and your teamâ€™s performance

---

## Variants

* Jeopardy
* Attack-Defence
* Mixed

----

### Jeopardy

* Challenges from various categories
* Most famous
* Find the flag
	* Usually of a format like `xyzCTF{}`
* Sometimes, dynamic scoring -> more solves, less points
* Other cool points like `First Blood` for the first solve

----

### Attack-Defence

* Each team will be given a vulnerable service
* Teams will defend their own service and patch it up
* Simultaneously, attack the other teams' services and develop exploits

----

### Mixed

* Varying formats and rules according to the organizer

---

## Categories

* Web Exploitation
* Reverse Engineering
	* Binary Exploitation
* Forensics
	* Steganography
* Cryptography
* OSINT
* Programming

### Web Exploitation

### Reverse Engineering

- In simple terms Reverse Engineering refers to the process of deconstructing any engineered object to figure out the internal mechanisms.

- Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled program ( like apk, exe, elf ) and converting it back into a more human readable format.

- The goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.

## Writeups

* Make sure to record your approaches
* Preferably in markdown, because
	* Plain text -> easily transferrable
	* No need to install another application
	* Your favourite text editor will do
* Will benefit others as well

---

## Blog

* Blogs are cool
* If you are perfectly sane and dislike any or all of the following
	* front-end web development
	* writing content in HTML
	* CSS styling
	* creating your webpage from scratch
* **Jekyll** is your friend
* Write content in markdown and Jekyll will generate the HTML for it
* **GitHub pages** offers free and easy hosting solution for static sites
